"""``TensorDataPacker`` — a generic data packer for non-text (e.g.
Gymnasium) RL trajectories.

Cosmos-RL's default ``DataPacker`` assumes the rollout output is text
that requires tokenization.  For RL workloads where the rollout produces
tensor trajectories (observations, actions, rewards, terminated /
truncated flags, episode length), this packer handles the
rollout↔trainer plumbing without invoking a real tokenizer.

It is a thin, transport-agnostic base class:

* :meth:`get_rollout_input` simply forwards the dataset sample (which
  for gym-style tasks typically carries seed / initial-condition
  metadata).
* :meth:`get_policy_input` accepts a trajectory dict and passes it
  through unchanged so the trainer can consume the tensors directly.
* :meth:`policy_collate_fn` returns the list of per-episode dicts
  unchanged; collation across episodes is left to the trainer because
  RL trajectories typically have variable lengths and the trainer
  knows the right batching/padding strategy for its algorithm.

Subclasses can override :meth:`get_rollout_output` /
:meth:`get_policy_input` to add transport-specific behavior (e.g.
inserting a UCXX reference dict in place of the raw tensors and
materializing it on the policy side).

    """Generic non-text data packer for tensor trajectories.

    Cosmos-RL invokes the data packer in three phases:

    1. Rollout setup — :meth:`get_rollout_input` converts a dataset
       sample to the input the rollout engine consumes.  For Gymnasium
       tasks this is typically the seed / initial-condition dict.
    2. Rollout output — :meth:`get_rollout_output` post-processes the
       trajectory dicts produced by the rollout engine.  The default
       implementation is a passthrough; subclasses can replace
       ``completions`` with reference handles (e.g. UCXX slot ids) and
       resolve them on the policy side.
    3. Policy input — :meth:`get_policy_input` converts each rollout
       output to the trainer's per-episode payload.  The default
       implementation passes the trajectory dict through unchanged so
       the trainer sees the same shape it produced.
