"""NCCLRolloutMixin — producer side of the in-tree NCCL payload transport.

Mirrors :class:`UCXXRolloutMixin` but moves bytes with NCCL P2P instead of
UCXX/SHM.  Responsibilities:

* :meth:`setup_nccl` — build the trajectory schema, the backpressured
  :class:`SendBufferRegistry`, the lazy :class:`CommCache`, the transfer
  stream pool, and start the request-serving + cleanup-subscriber threads.
* :meth:`write_to_buffer` — pack a trajectory into a fixed-schema GPU
  buffer, record a compute-stream ready-event, register the buffer, and
  return dict metadata (plus the ``nccl:<id>`` completion string).
* the serve loop — a **bounded sender-thread pool** answers ``:nccl_req``
  requests with ``nccl_send`` on a per-process transfer stream, so a slow
  peer head-of-line-blocks only its own request, not all pairs.
* the cleanup subscriber — frees GPU buffers when the controller discards
  the rollout (``nccl_cleanup`` channel).

Concurrency model (from the pynccl review)
------------------------------------------
pynccl P2P runs inline on the caller thread as CUDA-stream-async enqueues;
an ``ncclSend`` only *completes* once the peer posts the matching recv.  A
single serve thread that syncs per-send would head-of-line-block every
pair, so requests are dispatched to a bounded thread pool and each send
carries a finite ``timeout_ms``; a transient failure quarantines the pair
via the comm cache rather than wedging the worker.

        A send in flight (event recorded but not yet fired) is a raw NCCL read
        on the transfer stream that PyTorch's caching allocator does NOT track,
        so dropping the last reference now could let the storage be reused while
        NCCL is still reading it -> corrupted payload.  So wait for every
        recorded send-complete event -- but **bounded**: ``Event.synchronize``
        has no timeout and would hang forever if a send never got a matching
        recv (receiver crash / discard race), so poll ``query`` up to the send
        timeout and release regardless once it elapses.  The registry invokes
        this OUTSIDE its lock, so the wait blocks nothing.

        Ordering: first wait out any still-open send LEASE (``inflight`` -- a
        send that has been accepted but not yet recorded its completion event,
        e.g. it is still blocked on the launch lock or ready_event).  Freeing
        the storage while a lease is open would drop ``entry.buffer`` before the
        send even reads it.  Because ``add_done_event`` / ``abandon_inflight``
        mutate the entry object directly, this resolves correctly even after the
        entry was evicted / freed out of the registry.

        The lease wait and the event-drain wait get SEPARATE budgets (each the
        full send timeout) rather than sharing one deadline: otherwise a lease
        that consumes most of the budget would leave almost no time for the
        recorded events to actually drain before the unconditional release.
        Each phase stays independently bounded, so a wedged sender still cannot
        hang teardown -- at the cost of freeing live storage only in the
        pathological case where a genuine send outlives 2x the send timeout.
