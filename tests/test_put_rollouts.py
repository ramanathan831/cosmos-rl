Regression tests for ``PolicyStatusManager.put_rollouts``.

Pins the fix for the on-policy rollout-drop deadlock: ``put_rollouts`` must
admit every rollout in an incoming batch regardless of the
``on_policy_rollout_completed`` flag, because that flag is a trainer
notification primitive, not a producer-side admission gate.

The previous buggy behaviour was:
  1. Early-return at the top of ``put_rollouts`` when the flag was already
     ``True``, dropping the entire batch.
  2. ``break`` inside the loop when the pending queue drained, dropping the
     remaining rollouts in the same batch.

Either drop, combined with the controller's prompt-dispatch racing ahead of
the trainer's flag reset, deadlocks the on-policy producer-consumer pipeline.
